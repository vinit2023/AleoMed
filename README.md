# AleoMed



## zkMed: zkML platform for medical data research
zkMed enables the use of sensitive data, such as human DNA, to build and validate machine learning models in a privacy-preserving manner.

## The problem zkMed: zkML platform for medical data research solves
Machine Learning holds great promise for advancing medicine by analyzing data, but challenges arise in collecting and using data for model training due to privacy, legal, and economic issues.

The platform addresses these challenges, enabling trustless and privacy-preserving data collection. The sensitive data never leaves user's computer, ML model is run inside Aleo

## Challenges I ran into
Unfortunately Aleo platform was not very stable when it was time to deploy the contract.
