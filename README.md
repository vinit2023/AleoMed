## zkMed: zkML platform for medical data research
zkMed enables the use of sensitive data, such as human DNA, to build and validate machine learning models in a privacy-preserving manner.

## The problem zkMed: zkML platform for medical data research solves
Machine Learning holds great promise for advancing medicine by analyzing data, but challenges arise in collecting and using data for model training due to privacy, legal, and economic issues.

Our platform addresses these challenges, enabling trustless and privacy-preserving data collection. The sensitive data never leaves user's computer, ML model is run inside Aleo

## Challenges I ran into
Unfortunately Aleo platform was not very stable when it was time to deploy the contract.

Next.js











This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
